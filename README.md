# Fetal-Healt

Cardiotocograms (CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality. The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and more.
This project is aimed to classify the child in three categories: Normal, Suspect and Pathological, based on the data collected by the CTG.
